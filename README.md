Group Project: Game: "Henrietta the Hippopotamus's Wild Run"
By Ellie, Nikki, and Brooks

In order to run the game:
All files must be downloaded and in the same folder. Then run the FINALGAME.py file in order to play the game. It will be drawn on another screen which will display what to do next.

In order to play the game:
The game is pretty self explanatory, and shows what to do and how to do it on the direction screen. 
The title screen will pop up when you first run the file FINALGAME.py. To exit and close the window at any point in the game, you can press the key E. From the title screen, press the right arrow and the directions will pop up and tell you how to play. After hitting the right arrow again, the setting is drawn and you can click Enter and the obstacles will start generating.**
After pressing enter, you can use the Up and Down arrows to jump over and duck under obstacles. Each obstacle dodged will be recorded and the goal is to dodge as many as possible. If you hit an object, the game automatically ends and the results are displayed. Then E is pressed to close the window.

**Note: DO NOT PRESS THE RIGHT ARROW AFTER THE SETTING IS DRAWN. The directions say to press enter, but if you get trigger happy(?) right arrow happy(?) or just dislike following directions, and press the right arrow when you aren't supposed to, it will break the game.

*** ABOVE NOTE should be fixed
